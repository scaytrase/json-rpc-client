# RPC Library

Built-in support for batch-like requests. Processing depends on client implementation (may not be real batch)

## Common interfaces
  * RPC request (call)
  * RPC response (result)
  * RPC error
## Decorators
  * Lazy client decorator
  * Loggable client decorator
  * Cacheable client decorator
